# Implement

Implement a feature using Test-Driven Development.

## Arguments
$ARGUMENTS - Feature description or ID from specs/features.json

## Instructions

Activate the `implement-tdd` skill:

1. Write failing test first (RED)
2. Verify test fails
3. Write minimum code to pass (GREEN)
4. Verify test passes
5. Refactor if needed
6. Commit with descriptive message
7. Update specs/features.json

Never write code without a failing test first.
Never modify tests to make them pass - fix the code instead.
