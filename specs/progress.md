# Development Progress - v2

## Project: Claude Autonomous Development Framework v2
**Started:** 2026-01-09
**Goal:** Build a self-improving, longer-running framework

---

## Session 1: Bootstrap

### Initialization
- Copied v1 framework as base
- Created v2 specification
- Defined 15 features across 6 categories:
  - Core (2): Loop control, circuit breakers
  - Context (2): Pressure monitoring, hierarchical memory
  - Tracking (2): Dependencies, effort estimation
  - Testing (2): Pyramid enforcement, flaky detection
  - Errors (2): Classification, root cause analysis
  - Orchestration (2): Parallel execution, agent protocol
  - Metrics (2): Collection, self-optimization
  - Integration (1): Enhanced orchestrator

### Context
- Research analysis available in: ai-docs/research-analysis.md
- v2 specification in: specs/v2-specification.md

### Next Steps
1. Plan implementation approach for core features (F001, F002)
2. Design enhanced hook architecture
3. Begin TDD implementation
